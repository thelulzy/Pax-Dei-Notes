# 1) 1F6888
1F₁₆ = 31₁₀
C is the 3rd character of the alphabet, while A is the 1st. Thus, 31 -> Ca.

Carbon is atomic number 6, while Oxygen is atomic number 8.
1F -> Ca
6 -> C
888 -> OOO
CaCOOO -> CaCO3

44 12 is tap code for the letters "TB", which has been interpreted to mean "Telford Bridge", referring to the [Invermoriston Bridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tEVLBNwN3eW6YVjx7) on River Moriston, built by [Thomas Telford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Telford).

Telford was the "First President of the Institution of Civil Engineers" ([source](https://www.ice.org.uk/what-is-civil-engineering/who-are-civil-engineers/thomas-telford)), aka ICE. 

Civil Engineers -> Cement -> Calcium Carbonate

# 5) Snowflake
Ice -> Calcium Carbonate
> As water freezes, the dissolved minerals calcium and carbon solidify into tiny particles of calcium carbonate. ([source](https://www.lg.com/us/support/help-library/particles-in-the-ice-CT10000021-1337884210460))
