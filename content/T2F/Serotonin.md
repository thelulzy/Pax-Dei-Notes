> Serotonin is also produced in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), specifically in the [brainstem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem "Brainstem")'s [raphe nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphe_nuclei "Raphe nuclei"), the skin's [Merkel cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkel_cells "Merkel cells"), [pulmonary neuroendocrine cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_neuroendocrine_cell "Pulmonary neuroendocrine cell") and the tongue's [taste receptor cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste_bud "Taste bud"). Additionally, it is stored in blood [platelets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet "Platelet") and is released during agitation and vasoconstriction, where it then acts as an [agonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist "Agonist") to other platelets. About 8% is found in platelets and 1–2% in the CNS. The serotonin is secreted [luminally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy) "Lumen (anatomy)") and [basolaterally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basolateral "Basolateral"), which leads to increased serotonin uptake by circulating platelets and activation after stimulation, which gives increased stimulation of [myenteric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myenteric "Myenteric") neurons and [gastrointestinal motility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_motility "Gastrointestinal motility"). The remainder is synthesized in serotonergic [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron "Neuron") of the CNS, where it has various functions, including the regulation of mood, [appetite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite "Appetite"), and [sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep "Sleep").

> In drying [seeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed "Seed"), serotonin production is a way to get rid of the buildup of poisonous [ammonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia "Ammonia"). The ammonia is collected and placed in the [indole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indole "Indole") part of L-[tryptophan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan "Tryptophan"), which is then [decarboxylated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decarboxylation "Decarboxylation") by [tryptophan decarboxylase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_L-amino_acid_decarboxylase "Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase") to give tryptamine, which is then [hydroxylated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylation "Hydroxylation") by a [cytochrome P450 monooxygenase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_monooxygenase "Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase"), yielding serotonin.
